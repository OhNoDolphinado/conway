// 1. initialize the game (takes inputs size, # of times run, and a way to fill cells (ie seed it))-- done
// 2. run the game every time in a while loop, which iterates through and checks each cell (count of live cells in 8 cells around it)
// make sure to write to a temp 2D array 
// 3. print every time it runs
// we need a printer function that converts the 2D array of 1s and 0s to something readable, perhaps with unicode squares (⬛ and ⬜)-- done

// CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE RULES: 
// 1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
// 2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
// 3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
